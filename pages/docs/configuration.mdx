# Configuration reference

## Environment variables

These environment variables can be set in the [`.env`](https://github.com/webhood-io/webhood/blob/main/.env.example) file or in the environment where the docker-compose is run. Note that these environment variables may not be the same as the ones used by individual containers. Refer to the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/webhood-io/webhood/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file for the environment variables used by each container.

For example, to set the log level of the scanner container, use the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:

```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml"
  scanner:
    environment:
      LOG_LEVEL: ${SCANNER_LOG_LEVEL:-info}
```

### Required

| Name                 | Description                                                                                                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SCANNER_TOKEN`       | Secret key used by the `scanner` container to authenticate to the backend.                                                       |

### Optional
| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Default    |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `EXTERNAL_URL`       | URL of the Webhood instance used by end users to access the backend if the backend.                                                       |
| `SELF_REGISTER`      | Allow users to signup themselves instead of requiring administrators to create new user accounts manually. Exposes a `Register` tab in the login page.

| `SCANNER_NO_PRIVATE_IPS`      | Prevent scanner from scanning URLs that resolve to private IP addressess. Enabling this setting causes the scanner to also not scan any URLs that cannot be resolved from DNS.

Use this only for evaluation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `8000`     |
