# Security

## Architecture

The following diagram shows the architecture of the application. The diagram shows the components as they are deployed in containers using the docker-compose file.:

PocketBase (the backend) is responsible for handling all authentication and authorization.

## Security considerations

## Security checklist âœ“

Before you consider your deployment to be production-ready, you should have completed the following checklist:

### Mandatory

The following items are mandatory for production readiness. You must not omit any of these items.:

    * [ ] Secure environment variables are used for all sensitive variables, including database credentials, API keys, and secrets.
    * [ ] Users are able to access the application only via HTTPS.

### Recommended

The following items are recommended. You may choose not implement these after considering the trade offs in your environment.

    * [ ] The application is deployed to a private network with connectivity from your internal users only.
    * [ ] You are running the application in a dedicated host or VM.
    * [ ] You have set up a production-grade TLS certificate for the application signed by trusted CA.

## Risks

The following table lists notable risks that are associated with the application. The table also lists the recommended mitigation actions to lower the likelihood and/or impact of the risk as well as response actions in case the risk is realized.

You can rotate the JWT secret simply by changing it. All previously created user sessions and tokens will cease to function.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Scanner browser is compromised. The scanner engine uses a Chrome browser to perform the scans. In case of vulnerability in the browser or the scanner engine, an attack on the scanned website may bypass some controls and access. | Keep scanner image updated. The highest likelihood for this event is if the browser itself contains a high severity vulnerability. The browser is constantly updated witihin the scanner image and thus using the newest image significantly lowers possibility of this occuring. | The scanner container contains only ephemeral data, thus one option is simply to recreate the container. If a more serious breach is suspected to have occurred, you should initiate your security incident response procedures as well as contact us in case you suspect a vulnerability within the application contributed to the breach. |
