# Add a scanner

This guide will show you how to add a scanner to connect to your console. Scanner is the component that runs the scans and reports the results back to the console.

<Callout type="info">
  If you followed the [deployment guide](/docs/deployment), you should already have a scanner running in the same host as the UI and the backend (i.e. the console). This guide is for adding additional scanners.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- A console up and running ([see deployment guide](/docs/deployment)).
- Host that you can run the scanner on. This guide will assume one of the following:
  - docker
  - docker-compose
- Connectivity from the scanner to the console. If you are running the scanner on a different network, you will need to open the console port to the scanner network. Default port for the console is `8000` if using the deployment guide.

# Steps

## In the console

<Steps>
### Run command to create the scanner

These commands assume you have deployed the console using the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/webhood-io/webhood/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).

<Tabs items={["docker compose", "docker-compose", "docker"]}>
  <Tab>
      ```shell copy
         docker compose run backend create_scanner_token
      ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
      ```shell copy
         docker-compose run backend create_scanner_token
      ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
      ```shell copy
         docker exec -it webhood-scanner sh -c /pb/backend create_scanner_token
      ```
      Where `webhood-scanner` is the name of the container running the [backend image](https://github.com/webhood-io/webhood/pkgs/container/webhood%2Fbackend).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
This returns
      ```shell
         SCANNER_TOKEN=ey....
      ```
</Steps>

## In the scanner host

<Steps>
### Create a `.env` file with the scanner token

```shell copy filename=".env"
SCANNER_TOKEN=ey....
ENDPOINT=http://console-address:8000
``` 

Where `http://console-address:8000` is the address of the console. If you are running the console on a different port or network, you will need to change the `ENDPOINT` variable.

### Download the [seccomp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp) profile for the scanner

```shell copy
curl -o chrome.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webhood-io/webhood/main/files/chrome.json
```

<Tabs items={["docker compose", "docker-compose", "docker"]}>
  <Tab>
### Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the scanner configuration

```yaml copy filename="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  scanner:
    container_name: webhood-scanner
    image: ghcr.io/webhood-io/webhood/scanner:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      ENDPOINT: ${ENDPOINT}
      SCANNER_TOKEN: ${SCANNER_TOKEN}
      #  Scanner is not able to receive realtime updates from the console if it is using a self-signed certificate. 
      #  We therefore recommend using valid certificate or plain HTTP for the scanner.
      #  But, comment out next line if you are using a self-signed certificate and HTTPS anyway. 
      # NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED: 0
    security_opt:
      # Use seccomp to restrict the syscalls that the container can make for Chrome
      # This allows us to run chrome with sandboxing enabled without having to run the whole container as root
      - seccomp=./chrome.json
      ```
### Run the scanner and check for any errors

      ```shell copy
         docker compose up
      ```

It is a good idea to now initiate some scans in the console to see if the scanner is working correctly.

### If no errors, you can start the scanner as a daemon

      ```shell copy
         docker compose up -d
      ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
### Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the scanner configuration

```yaml copy
services:
  scanner:
    container_name: webhood-scanner
    image: ghcr.io/webhood-io/webhood/scanner:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      ENDPOINT: ${ENDPOINT}
      SCANNER_TOKEN: ${SCANNER_TOKEN}
    security_opt:
      # Use seccomp to restrict the syscalls that the container can make for Chrome
      # This allows us to run chrome with sandboxing enabled without having to run the whole container as root
      - seccomp=./chrome.json
      ```
### Run the scanner and check for any errors

      ```shell copy
         docker-compose up
      ```

It is a good idea to now initiate some scans in the console to see if the scanner is working correctly.

### If no errors, you can start the scanner as a daemon

      ```shell copy
         docker-compose up -d
      ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
### Start the scanner

    ```shell copy
    # docker run equivalent of the docker-compose.yml
    docker run -d \
        --name webhood-scanner \
        --env-file .env \
        --security-opt seccomp=./chrome.json \
        ghcr.io/webhood-io/webhood/scanner:latest
      ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Steps>

## Additional configuration

### Additional scanners

The `create_scanner_token` command with no arguments will create a new scanner token for the default scanner present in all installations. 

To create a token for an additional scanner, you can run

<Tabs items={["docker compose", "docker-compose", "docker"]}>
  <Tab>
```shell copy
docker compose run backend create_scanner --u "scanner-name"
# Then create an auth token for that scanner
docker compose run backend create_scanner_token --u "scanner-name"
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```shell copy
docker-compose run backend create_scanner --u "scanner-name"
# Then create an auth token for that scanner
docker-compose run backend create_scanner_token --u "scanner-name"
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```shell copy
docker exec -it webhood-scanner sh -c /pb/backend create_scanner --u "scanner-name"
# Then create an auth token for that scanner
docker exec -it webhood-scanner sh -c /pb/backend create_scanner_token -u "scanner-name"
```
  </Tab>
