## What is Webhood?

Webhood is a URL scanner that helps you analyze suspicious websites, such as suspected phishing sites and quickly find out whether they are safe to visit or whether you should suspect the site to be a phishing site intended to lure victims into inserting their credentials or fall victim to other scams.

Webhood is designed primarily for cybersecurity professionals, but is can also be deployed to support other use cases. The primary use case for Webhood is to quickly check what's behind a URL by a person able recognize phishing from common indicators such as typosquatting, impersonating legitimate brands and other common indicators of a phishing site. Webhood brings you tools to analyze, but does not provide any automated analysis.

One of the key reasons why Webhood exists, is to allow you to set up your own scanner instance and not have to worry about sharing data with third parties. Although sharing information about suspected phishing sites with the cybersecurity community is a good thing, links may also very well be legitimate and for instance, an URL contained in an email may also contain information about the recipient that should not be shared anywhere outside your organization.

Webhood is created to enable cybersecurity professionals to check URL's without having to share the URL with any third parties, which is a common practice with other URL scanners. Webhood is designed to be a self-hosted solution, so you can run it on your own infrastructure.
