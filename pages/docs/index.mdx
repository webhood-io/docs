## What is Webhood?

Webhood is a tool that scans URLs to help you determine if a website is safe to visit or if it's a phishing site that may try to steal your credentials or scam you in other ways. It's primarily designed for cybersecurity professionals, but can also be used for other purposes.

Webhood is useful for quickly checking the legitimacy of a website, especially for people who can recognize phishing indicators such as typosquatting or impersonation of legitimate brands. It provides tools for analysis, but does not offer any automated analysis.

One of the main reasons why Webhood exists to allow you to set up your own scanner instance, rather than sharing data with third parties. Sharing information about phishing sites with the cybersecurity community can be helpful, but sometimes links may be legitimate or contain sensitive information that should not be shared. With Webhood, you can check URLs without sharing them with any third parties, as it is a self-hosted solution that can be run on your own infrastructure.
