# Tines and Webhood integration

Tines is a no-code automation platform that allows you to automate repetitive tasks and workflows and is a great tool for integrating with Webhood. In this guide, we'll show you how to use Tines to create a simple workflow that integrates with Webhood.


## Example story

To get started with Tines and Webhood integration, we've created a simple story that demonstrates how to use the email trigger and Webhood actions in Tines.

<Carousel 
  opts={{
    align: "center",
  }}>
  <CarouselContent>
    <CarouselItem>
        <Image priority src="/tines/story/storyboard.png" width={2925/4} height={2177/4}/>
    </CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem>
        <Image src="/tines/story/1-received.png" width={1204} height={612}/>
    </CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem>
        <Image src="/tines/story/2-sent.png" width={1726} height={920} />
    </CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem>
        <Image src="/tines/story/3-results-mail.png" width={1356} height={992} />
    </CarouselItem>
    <CarouselItem>
        <Image src="/tines/story/4-results-webhood.png" width={1984} height={1384} />
    </CarouselItem>
  </CarouselContent>
  <CarouselPrevious />
  <CarouselNext />
</Carousel>
